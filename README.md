A rules engine/move generator for the game [Havannah](https://www.mindsports.nl/index.php/arena/havannah) by Christian Freeling. 

This is currently a rather naive implementation written in Rust. I connected a library that runs the Monte Carlo Search Tree. There is currently no wiring to play vs the computer and no Gui.

The name is the Arabic root for "connection": وصل, Havannah being a connection game.

## Roadmap

Nothing in particular, however some ideas are:

- get a GUI running. Use macroquad maybe?
- improve the Board representation (for more speeeeed)

## License

MIT license. Don't care what you do with this, but give credit.

## Contribute

Suggestions and help welcome.

Please play around with it, abuse it, and let me know you things should work.
